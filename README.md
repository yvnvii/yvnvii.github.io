# Projects
- Research Assistant (2024/1 - present) at Columbia's Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain and Behavior Institute  
Working at Fitzpatrick lab, which explores the molecular and structural basis of neurodegeneration and memory using cryo-electron microscopy with complementary biophysical techniques (proteomics, light-microscopy, microfluidics.) In the lab, our team tries to determine the structure and behavior of amyloid fibrils, purified directly from postmortem human brain tissue, that are implicated in a range of neurodegenerative diseases and explore their interactome.  

- Full-time Summer Research Assistant (2024/5 - 2024/8)  
Funded by the Rabi Scholars Office of Columbia, working full time for Fitzpatrick Lab at Zuckerman Institute and studying a disease called Preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is known as a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality, characterized by its possibility of sudden progression to severe stages. Recent studies have shown that in the urine of women with preeclampsia, a protein called uromodulin excesses with the presence of amyloid fibril formation. This research aims to establish a new biomarker to diagnose preeclampsia in the earlier stage by quantifying changes in the amount of uromodulin and amyloid fibrils that appear in the urine across various stages of preeclampsia throughout gestation.
